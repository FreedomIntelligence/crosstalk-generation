0: Very dangerous!
1: There is something wrong with you, why do you yell "so dangerous" as soon as you meet.
0: What are you busy with recently?
1: Say it to scare you to death
0: What is so mysterious
1: AI face changing, haven't you heard of it!
0: I heard, this is a hot topic
1: Do you know what it can do?
0: Let the actors not be used to record episodes. They can use AI to change faces and voices, and shoot an episode in the office.
1: Yes, yes, this is my idea.
0: Why do you have this idea?
1: Because I saw a news that AI is expanding massively. And I now have an idea.
0: What are you doing?
1: Through artificial intelligence to open up the entire film and television industry, bringing some new changes to the entire film and television industry.
0: You talk about what you think.
1: AI face-changing, we first make a drama, and then use artificial intelligence to produce it.
0: What do you think?
1: Do you not support it?
0: I support, I just ask, can you do it?
1: I can do it.
0: That's fine, I'll let people take a look later.
1: Yes, yes, it is not good to say something too early.
0: What's the matter? Thank you all for coming. Everyone knows that AI can make a difference in many fields. It has great application prospects in the film industry, film and television industry, Internet industry, and medical field.
1: yes yes yes.
0: But the AI ​​face changing we are talking about now has a special application scenario.
1: Oh?
0: It is the film and television industry.
1: Oh?
0: Because artificial intelligence can learn through voice and video, we can make a series by changing faces through AI.
1: yes yes yes.
0: But this episode needs to have an actor for it.
1: Oh?
0: So we need an actor for this show right now.
1: Okay, tell me, who will appear in this drama?
0: We are looking for an actor with acting skills.
1: Oh?
0: But this person can't be too expensive.
1: Oh?
0: Because our show is not very high-end, we are looking for an actor with acting skills, but not too expensive.
1: Oh?
0: What's going on? Do you have a choice?
1: I have.
0: Who is it? Tell me.
1: Li Yahe.


0: Hello!
1: Hello!
0: I am very happy today
1: Yes, there are so many friends
0: I am more concerned about current affairs recently
1: Mind the world!
0: Yes, just like this migrant worker is the best
1: Yes!
0: But some people say that this migrant worker is not good
1: Yes, what do you mean?
0: I think there is nothing wrong with this migrant worker
1: What did you say?
0: Because I have seen some social problems, that is, the migrant workers are very hard.
1: Yes, that's enough!
0: But sometimes I see some problems in other industries, including when we record variety shows on TV.
1: What did you say?
0: Some show actors, ah, took the money and ran away.
1: Yes!
0: How many people do you see in this industry?
1: A lot!
0: But I see, hey, a bunch of people in this industry.
1: How do you say it?
0: When we record variety shows on TV, we can't actually say that this is a group of characters. Because there are a lot of famous people here. Did you see it? Come and come! Mr. Guo, Guo Degang.
1: Yes, we are celebrities.
0: How many people do you see in this industry?
1: A lot!
0: But I don't think any of these characters is better than Mr. Guo. Because he is not only good when recording shows. good in life.
1: How do you say it?
0: Look at his face, hey, he's better than me.
1: How do you say it?
0: But sometimes I see some other characters who are not good in life.
1: What's going on?
0: Many people say that Mr. Guo is very hard.
1: Yes!
0: But some people say that Mr. Guo can get it cheap.
1: What do you mean?
0: Because he, hey, took so much money.
1: Yes!
0: But I think Mr. Guo is not only rich.
1: How do you say it?
0: He still has a face.
1: How do you say it?


0: What shall we say today?
1: Today we talk about something different.
0: I've been a little depressed recently
1: Huh, what is there to be depressed about?
0: I am more concerned about current affairs recently
1: What is the current event?
0: For example, the recent wave of programmers working overtime in 996
1: Hey, did you say this?
0: Have you heard?
1: I heard it.
0: So what do you think?
1: I think this 996 overtime tide of programmers, what does it mean?
0: Don't mention it, I heard about this programmer 996 working overtime, and I was a little depressed.
1: Then what are you depressed about?
0: Because I am a software engineer.
1: Yes.
0: But I don't usually work overtime.
1: Yes.
0: So those people called 996 actually seem to work harder than me in normal times.
1: How do you say? Let's talk about it!
0: Go back and ask the boss for overtime pay.
1: No! No overtime pay.
0: why?
1: Because you don't usually work overtime, the boss thinks that you work efficiently.
0: Yes.
1: So if you want to work overtime, the boss will definitely use this as an excuse, saying that your work efficiency is not high, and you are not allowed to work overtime.
0: How can I do this? I have always been rewarded for attendance!
1: What does full attendance award mean?
0: That is to get full attendance bonus every month.
1: Oh! You're not right, you said you get a monthly attendance bonus.
0: Yes!
1: So can your management see it?
0: What does it mean?
1: You are just a guinea pig, what else can you do?
0: What abilities can I have? Can I not? I am much stronger than others.
1: You are much stronger than others, and you look much worse than others.
0: How do you say it! I don't usually work hard, but I am more efficient than other programmers.
1: What did you say? You are very efficient.
0: I am efficient.
1: You look much worse than others, how can you say that you are efficient?
0: Because I have a little trick.
1: Oh! What little trick?


0: Here, brother?
1: Huh!, long time no see!
0: What are you busy with recently?
1: Say it to scare you to death
0: What is so mysterious
1: I recently researched this preconsumption
0: Heh, you are amazing
1: That's not
0: what do you mean
1: I have developed a new consumption concept
0: Oh, then you can talk about it
1: Excessive consumption
0: Excessive consumption?
1: Yes, over-consumption
0: Isn't that already there?
1: No, do you know what is over-consumption?
0: no
1: This over-consumption is something that has been around for a long time
0: oh
1: But I invented a new name to represent it
0: Huh! That's enough!
1: What's wrong? You don't believe me?
0: No, I believe you
1: If you don't believe it, forget it
0: Oh, don't be angry
1: What's the matter? Do you still want to hear my theory?
0: Of course
1: OK, then I'll tell you how meaningful this theory is
0: What's the point?
1: This theory has great significance for the entire human race!
0: Oh! Really? Then please tell me.
1: (step forward) Okay, let’s make it clear first.
0: oh
1: What are the benefits of this over-consumption?
0: What are the benefits?
1: Yes, what is it good for?
0: I don't know.
1: (step back) Look, look at this over-consumption.
0: oh
1: What are the benefits of it?
0: You talk about it.
1: What are the benefits of this over-consumption?
0: I don't know.
1: (step back) Look, look at this over-consumption.
0: Oh! I see, that's something that's been around for a long time.
1: (steps back) Yes, it already has something.
0: (steps back) What is the pre-consumption? Don't play with me! (steps forward)
